[![ETL Flight Data](https://github.com/bradfordjohnson/kchs/actions/workflows/etl-flight-data.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bradfordjohnson/kchs/actions/workflows/etl-flight-data.yaml)

This repository includes an Observable Framework dashboard that visualizes aviation data from KCHS. It also contains an automated Python workflow that collects historical data for both arrivals and departures once a day. Once sufficient historical data is gathered, a historical dashboard page and period comparison visuals will be added.
